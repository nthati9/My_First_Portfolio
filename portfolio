        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Onthatile Lwazi Mothibedi, a Software Engineer student from a beautiful township called Alexandra. She has a dream of becoming a Chiropractor and hopes that one day sheâ€™ll be able to incorporate it in the tech world. 
Onthatile was part of a science programme named IAMScience, where she was a science ambassador and learnt about scientific concepts behind science experiments and teamwork while conducting experiments. She also participated in a program named JASA Entrepreneurial Program where she was taught effective communication skills, marketing research and business development ideas. 

She hopes that one day she can create an application that helps all the chiropractors in Africa with the help of her being in the Software Engineering track and her dreams of being a Chiropractor. Her plan is to heal people and break the distance barrier at once.</p>
